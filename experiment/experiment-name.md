# **Image Enhancement**

## Problem Statement:

Digital images often contain unwanted noise and lack clarity due to factors such as poor lighting or sensor limitations. To improve the visual quality and highlight important details, image smoothing (for noise reduction) and image sharpening (for edge enhancement) are essential preprocessing operations in image processing pipelines. In this experiment, students are required to

• Apply smoothing filters (Mean, Gaussian, and Median) to reduce noise. 

• Apply sharpening filters (Laplacian and Unsharp Masking) to enhance edges. 

• Compare and visualize how these filters affect image quality and details.
