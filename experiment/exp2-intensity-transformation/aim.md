## Aim

To study and implement various intensity transformation techniques in digital image processing.

The objectives of this experiment are:

1. To understand the concept of gray-level transformation.
2. To implement image negative transformation.
3. To perform logarithmic transformation.
4. To apply power-law (gamma) transformation.
5. To observe the effect of contrast stretching on images.
6. To analyze histogram changes after intensity transformations.

Through this experiment, students will learn how modifying pixel intensity values affects image brightness and contrast.
